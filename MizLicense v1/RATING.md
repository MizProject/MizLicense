## Copilot's Review:

> Based on the clauses in your license agreement, particularly the requirements for attribution, restriction on changing the license, and liability disclaimers, it aligns more closely with permissive licenses. However, it incorporates some elements of control typical of copyleft licenses, such as the prohibition on altering the license and ensuring proper attribution.

> So, it sits somewhat in the middle but leans towards the permissive side with its openness and fewer restrictions compared to more stringent copyleft licenses.

## Gemini's Review

> Your license strikes a balance between permissiveness and ensuring proper attribution. It's a good choice if you want to encourage widespread use and modification of your software while still acknowledging your contributions.

> However, consider the following:

> Clarity: <br>While the license is generally clear, some terms could be more concise or precise. For example, the "Additional Credits" section could be more specific about the required level of detail for citing differences between forked versions.

>Legal Review: It's always advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure your license complies with relevant laws and regulations, especially if you plan to distribute your software commercially.
By addressing these points, you can further strengthen your license and protect your interests while promoting open-source development.

## ChatGPT's Review

> This license offers flexibility while ensuring that the original creator retains credit and control over changes to the license terms. The requirements for attribution and fork differentiation are clear and reasonable, helping users understand what’s original and what’s modified. However, it may be worth specifying further what constitutes “proper attribution” to avoid ambiguity. Also, since you require attribution for any usage, even privately, this could be viewed as a stronger copyleft approach than standard permissive licenses.
