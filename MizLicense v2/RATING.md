## ChatGPT's Review

Your agreement is a hybrid of open source and proprietary elements. To clarify its stance:

If you want a more permissive license:

Remove the "Commercial Use Notification" clause or replace it with optional acknowledgment or sponsorship requests. This would align more with permissive licenses like MIT or Apache.
If you want a copyleft license:

Expand on requirements for derivative works (e.g., include a clause mandating that modifications remain under the same license).
If you want to keep the commercial notification:

Clarify the process for notifying the owner and whether there are fees or approvals involved. This currently makes the license less open source and more proprietary.
